	<h1>My Experience with sports</h1>
	<p>I have always loved sports, and done them my entire life, trying almost every one. Over the years, I have played Basketball, Soccer, Lacrosse, Swimming, dabbled in horseriding, and taken dance classes. At the moment, I am only actively playing lacrosse, but also on a swim team. Sports have always been a sancturary for me, and I have loved them since I was a little kid on a school soccer team. And besides the enjoyment I take in them, I'm a very athletic person, getting onto the highest lacrosse team, doing swim meets, being on the best soccer team our grade has, and just doing well in PE. I have always love the team part of sports, and made close friends throughtout my years on teams, along wth improving my skills a lot. </p>
