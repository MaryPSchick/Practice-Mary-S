<h1> Music: How it is in every aspect of my life </h1>
<p>I think music has always been a sort of "safe place" for me over the years, a comfort for me whenever things got hard. I have so many great memories of listening to music with people, from listening to kpop on walks with my best friend, to geeking out over old music with my dad. My family has always been very into listening to music, so I grew up with music all around me, on long road trips, or my parents making dinner, or when my family is doing a puzzle, music feels like home to me.</p>
<p> Besides just listening to music with other people, I have devoloped my own taste in music, and listen to music daily, from going on runs, to doing my homework, to just while im reading or on my phone, my earbuds are an essiantial part of my life. When i listen to music by myself, I listen to all sorts of music, from pop, to kpop, to musical soundtracks, my taste ranges far and wide, with a strong exception of country. </p>
