	<h1> Ranking my favorite trends right now</h1>
	<p> I have always loved fashion, but never really gotten to explore it and how much I love it until I got Social media this past summer, and could really see trends and what people were wearing. So, in honor of that, I am going to rate some of this seasons trends. </p>
	<ol>
		<li> starting with my fav, bright colors. I love the look of bright prints and patterns, and for summer i'm trying to buy more colorful stuff, to and some spice to my normally very dark closet.10/10</li>
		<li> chunky jewelry/beaded stuff, again with the color trend, being clay rings and beads are really in right now. I personally love this trend, and think its super cute. 10/20</li>
		<li> platforms! I love platforms, and this that they have always been super cute(flashbacks to the foam platforms I had in fifth grade) and love that there on the comeback. only drawback, they're impossible to walk in. 9/10</li>
	</ol>
